# Investigate a dataset

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

# Installs

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
  - Numpy 
```python
pip install numpy
```
  - Pandas
```python
pip install pandas
```
- Matplolib
 ```python
pip install matplotlib
```   
In case that you donÂ´t have the package intaller __pip__, you can follow this link:
[pip - The Python Package Installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)


# Concepts

- Data Wrangling

It's the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics

This may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. Data munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use

- EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis)

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task
