# Investigate a dataset

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

# Installs

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
  - Numpy 
```python
pip install numpy
```
  - Pandas

# Concept

- EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis)

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task
